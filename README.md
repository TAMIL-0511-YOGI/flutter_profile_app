# 👤 Flutter Profile App

This is my **Week 2 project** for the Flutter Bootcamp, where I transitioned from Dart foundations to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Flutter UI development. The app showcases my profile using core Flutter widgets and interactive elements.

## 📚 Project Overview

The Flutter Profile App is a simple yet functional UI that displays a profile image, name, bio, and a button to increment a counter (e.g., likes or followers). It demonstrates the use of both **Stateless** and **Stateful** widgets, along with basic layout and styling.

### ✅ Features

- Profile image display
- Name and short bio
- Interactive button to increase a counter
- Clean widget tree structure
- Use of OOP principles in helper classes (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Flutter SDK
- Dart (OOP concepts)
- VS Code / Android Studio
- Android Emulator or physical device

## 🧱 Widgets Used

- `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`
- `Text`, `Image`, `Column`, `Row`, `Container`
- `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: DartPad (Web)

1. Visit [DartPad Flutter](https://dartpad.dev/flutter)
2. Paste the code into the editor
3. Click **Run**

### Option 2: Local Flutter Setup

1. Install Flutter SDK and set up your IDE
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-profile-app.git
   cd flutter-profile-app
   flutter pub get
   flutter run


   🎯 Learning Goals
This project helped me:
- Understand and apply Dart OOP principles:
- Classes, Constructors, Encapsulation, Inheritance
- Build and structure a Flutter app
- Use layout widgets effectively
- Implement interactivity with Stateful widgets
